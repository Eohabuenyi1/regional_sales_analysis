# Regional_Sales_Analysis
This project performs a comprehensive regional sales analysis using Python to identify key revenue and profit drivers across products, sales channels, and geographic regions. It uncovers seasonal trends, highlights top- and bottom-performing products, and measures performance against budget targets. 
The insights from this analysis can be used to: 

Optimize pricing, promotion, and market expansion strategies. 

Reduce concentration risk by identifying over-reliance on specific products or regions. 

Align sales outcomes with business objectives for sustainable growth. 

 

Problem Statement 

Identify key revenue and profit drivers across products, channels, and regions, uncover seasonal trends and outliers, and align performance against budgets. Use these insights to optimize pricing, promotion, and market expansion for sustainable growth and reduced concentration risk.
